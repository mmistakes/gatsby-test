PaperFaces portrait of <a href="http://twiter.com/LizzieBeth_">@LizzieBeth_</a>. For this portrait I decided to make one of those most excellent speed drawing videos you see all over YouTube. In the past I used AirPlay on my iPad to mirror its display to my iMac that was running [**Reflector**](http://www.airsquirrels.com/reflector/) to capture the screen. This process has worked out great but since it only records the screen you miss out on actually seeing how I draw with a stylus.

To record the video below I used some knowledge I picked up last year when I created a [pregnancy time lapse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXd5oe_vOBE) of [my wife and twin girls](http://2littlerosebuds.com). Basically I setup my dSLR camera on a tripod behind me and tethered it to my iMac through a USB cable so I could use software to snap photographs every couple of seconds.

After grabbing around 1,000 images I imported them into **Adobe AfterEffects** as an image sequence, did some quick color corrections, added titles and music, and uploaded to YouTube.

The lighting kind of sucks and the focus is off in a few parts, but I think it came out ok for my second time lapse attempt. Next time I'll take more care to get my white balance correct upfront and make sure I don't bump into the tripod midway through the shoot.
