Decided to put some time in with 53's new Pencil stylus and experiment with the [Blend feature]({% post_url /mastering-paper/2013-11-20-pencil-first-look %}) some more. I may have pushed the blurs too far since I think it killed a lot of the layered watercolor textures I started withâ€¦

Mental note: a little Blend goes a long way.
