PaperFaces portrait of the Dark Knight to go along with a drawing I did of the [Clown Prince]({% post_url /paperfaces/2014-12-04-killing-joke-portrait %}) a few weeks ago.

The original illustration is [available on Mix](https://mix.fiftythree.com/11098-Michael-Rose/1420093) in various stages of completion if you want to rework it or get a closer look.
