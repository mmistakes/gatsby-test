PaperFaces portrait of Myriam J. inspired by a [photograph on Sktchy](http://sktchy.com/kMXyoD ).

Lately I've been trying to strike a balance between unfinished and over-worked by selectively adding detail to a piece. 

One thing I've found working digitally these last couple of years is it can be a challenge to capture the same *sketchy* quality of a real pencil. In some cases you have to do more work to fake it, which is probably why you find so many digital works that look over worked and airbrushed.
