PaperFaces portrait of [@Gustafsonlisa](https://twitter.com/Gustafsonlisa). For you Instagram lovers out there I shot a [15 second time lapse](http://instagram.com/p/azMK1xgU09/) using the new video feature added yesterday to the app. I'll probably experiment with it some more and record work in process sketches if I can get the iPad's screen to look less reflective.
