PaperFaces portrait of Emily D. inspired by a [photograph on Sktchy](http://sktchy.com/XBuFq ).

For the last week or so I've been experimenting with time lapse photography on my iPhone 5s. Creating time lapse videos of my Paper by FiftyThree works is nothing new for me, but recording the movement of my hands is... sort of.

I've begun experimenting with [Hyperlapse](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hyperlapse-from-instagram/id740146917?mt=8) for iOS along with the time lapse feature that is part of iOS 8. I like how Hyperlapse lets you adjust the playback speed but since it only records up to an hour of footage I've started using the iPhone's built-in Camera app more.

After I try out some other time lapse iOS apps I plan on sharing what I've learned. But for now here's a short video I shot, edited, and published with just an iPhone.
