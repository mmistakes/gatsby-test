## Blockquotes

Single line blockquote:

> Stay hungry. Stay foolish.

Multi line blockquote with a cite reference:

> People think focus means saying yes to the thing you've got to focus on. But that's not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully. I'm actually as proud of the things we haven't done as the things I have done. Innovation is saying no to 1,000 things.

## Footnotes

I first encountered footnotes at Daring Fireball[^daring-fireball] and have since seen them on [Shawn Blanc's site](http://shawnblanc.net/), and a few others. At first it was a novelty I would never need. Then I started really writing.

[^daring-fireball]:

  Here is John Gruber's post [About the Footnotes](http://daringfireball.net/2005/07/footnotes). Besides, what would a post about creating footnotes in HTML be without actually having at least one footnote to demonstrate?

Footnotes are also not a core feature of markdown, but they're a common extension feature. The footnote syntax looks like this:

```markdown
This line has a footnote [^footnote-1]. Scroll down or click the link to see it.
```

That renders like this:

This line has a footnote [^footnote-1]. Scroll down or click the link to see it.

	font-weight: bold;
	font-size: 38px;
