The preferred way of using images is placing them in the `../assets/images/` directory and referencing them with a relative path.

Standard image with no width modifier classes applied.

**HTML:**

```html
<img src="../assets/images/filename.jpg" alt="">
```

**or Markdown:**

```markdown
![alt](../assets/images/filename.jpg)
```
